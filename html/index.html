<h1>Hi there!</h1>

<!--This is the small paragraph for the assignment. Yes I copypasted it from my Linkedin.-->
<p >
 I'm a Senior Graphic Designer/Art Director from Brazil, and have been involved in communication
 and advertising design since 2014. I've worked with clients from various industries, ranging from retail
 to the luxury market, including sports apparel, food, healthcare, pharmaceutical, among others.
 <br><br>

 My experience encompasses projects that involve UX research and UX/UI design, as well as brand
 identity creation and conceptualization for online, offline, and interactive campaigns.
